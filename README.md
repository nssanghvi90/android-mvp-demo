# android-mvp-demo

This is a demo project for Model View Presenter pattern for Android project
Involves 3 components:
1. Model 
2. View   
3. Presenter

Create interfaces for Views and Presenters and code to those interfaces. Activities act as Views and presenters help to interface Views and Models .
Views are dumb components and never directly interact with Models
